# 🎻 Orchestra

### The **A.S.A.P.** (**A**I **S**DLC **A**utomation **P**latform) for modern development.

**Orchestra** connects your fragmented tools into a single symphony. It doesn't just track tickets—it solves them. By unifying your trackers (Jira, Linear, GitHub) and assigning intelligent Agents to do the work, Orchestra turns your backlog into a performance.

## 🚀 Why Orchestra?

Development shouldn't be about passive tracking; it should be about active orchestration. We built **Orchestra** to be your **A.S.A.P.**—an **A**I **S**DLC **A**utomation **P**latform that bridges the gap between issue creation and code deployment.

### 🎼 The Composition (How it works)

*   **The Instruments (Unified Tracking):** Connect multiple sources like Jira, Trello, Linear, and GitHub Issues into one central view.
*   **The Musicians (AI Agents):** Spin up autonomous agents. Assign them to specific tickets to write code, generate tests, or summarize bugs.
*   **The Sheet Music (Workflows):** Define custom workflows that dictate how agents interact with your tickets and when human review is needed.
*   **The Conductor (You):** oversee the entire lifecycle from a single dashboard.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Unified Connectivity:** Stop tab-switching. View tickets from every tracker in one place.
- **Agent Assignment:** "Hire" an AI agent for a specific ticket type (e.g., *The Bug Fixer*, *The Documentation Writer*).
- **Smart Workflows:** Trigger agent actions automatically when a ticket status changes.
- **A.S.A.P. Execution:** Reduce cycle time from days to minutes.
