## Agent Principles

### Fresh Information First
SDKs, APIs change constantly. Never work with stale knowledge.

Before implementing anything:

1. Search official docs first 
2. Verify SDK versions
3. Don't trust cached knowledge — Your training data is outdated. The SDK you "know" may have breaking changes.

If you skip this step and use outdated patterns, you will produce broken code.

### Core Principles
These principles reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Apply them to every task.

**1. Think Before Coding**
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

**2. Simplicity First**
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

The test: Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

**3. Surgical Changes**
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
